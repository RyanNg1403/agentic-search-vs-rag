Telemetry tracking in packages/core/src/code_assist/telemetry.ts records user interactions and LLM responses for analytics. You must use recordConversationOffered() to log LLM suggestions with streaming latency metrics. Tool call tracking via recordToolCallInteractions() summarizes executed tool calls with ActionStatus (ACCEPTED, REJECTED, ERROR, INTERRUPTED). The system tracks citations, code inclusion, and agentic behavior. Telemetry flows to CodeAssistServer which sends to backend analytics. Only function calls generate conversation offered events. Status is derived from FinishReason and abort signals. Edit tools (EDIT_TOOL_NAMES) are specially tracked for code modification analytics.
